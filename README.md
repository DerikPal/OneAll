OneAll
======

The .Net OneAll SDK originally created by me at XPG. Contains code examples that show you how to use OneAll REST API and how to implement and customize Social Login on your own website. The OneAll.Net SDK supports single and multiple OneAll REST API connections simultaneously. It also includes extension methods for use in ASP.Net Web Pages as well as extensions for .Net MVC Razor Engine and a singleton API class for easy server side interaction. Full CHM documentation is included.
